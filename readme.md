Note all the instructions that follow are for windows users and wsl2 won't work (ive tried)

Python version:
3.10.4
Pip version:
22.0.4

The program uses mayavi. To install type in the terminal:

* pip install mayavi

It is recommended to install this package and all others in a virtual enviroment.
To do so please type in the terminal:

Install virtualenv
* pip install virtualenv
Create the folder
* mkdir venv
* .\venv\Scripts\activate.bat
There should be a (venv) in the new terminal line. This means the virtualenv is activated.
if the last instruction does not work try: 
* .\venv\Scripts\activate

All packeges that are installed now will be installed in the venv folder.

To deactivate the virtual enviroment go to the terminal and type:
* deactivate
